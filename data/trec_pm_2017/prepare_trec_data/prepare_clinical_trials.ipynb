Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\\n      cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor\\n      cells.\\n\\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, surgery, and\\n      radiation therapy in treating children who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.\\n\\n\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\\n\\n      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response to vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin (VID) with\\n      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in children with newly diagnosed, inoperable\\n      or metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. II. Estimate the 2-year and\\n      event-free survival rates in children treated with VID plus radiotherapy and/or surgery.\\n      III. Establish a bank of frozen tumor and peripheral blood tissue for use in further\\n      molecular studies.\\n\\n      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte\\n      Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 Mesna\\n      Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VID VCR/IFF/DOX Induction:\\n      3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID. Local Control: Surgery and/or Radiotherapy plus 3-Drug\\n      Combination Chemotherapy. Excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases; and/or\\n      irradiation of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases using x-rays or Co60 beam energies\\n      of at least 4 MV (electrons or iridium-192 implant allowed for boost); plus VID.\\n      Continuation: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.
