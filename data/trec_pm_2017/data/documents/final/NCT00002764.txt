TITLE:
Surgery With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Lung Metastases From Soft Tissue Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Endometrial Cancer

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether surgery plus combination chemotherapy is more effective than surgery
      alone in treating patients with lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery plus combination
      chemotherapy with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma
      that has spread to the lung.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare disease control, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in
      patients with lung metastases secondary to soft tissue sarcoma treated with high-dose
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) before and after
      metastasectomy vs metastasectomy alone. II. Determine the safety and morbidity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      location of metastases (unilateral vs bilateral). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients are assigned to regimen A or B. Regimen A: Patients receive
      high-dose doxorubicin IV and ifosfamide IV continuously on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 3-13. Regimen B: Patients receive chemotherapy as above without
      G-CSF. Treatment on both regimens continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients then
      undergo radical pulmonary metastasectomy via thoracotomy or sternotomy with wedge resection
      or lobectomy. Patients with responding disease after metastasectomy receive 2 additional
      courses on the regimen to which they were originally assigned. Arm II: Patients undergo
      radical pulmonary metastasectomy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (170 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within approximately 4.5 years.
