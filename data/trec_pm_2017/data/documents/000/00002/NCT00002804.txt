TITLE:
Combination Chemotherapy, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Children With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma

CONDITION:
Sarcoma

INTERVENTION:
filgrastim

SUMMARY:

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, surgery, and
      radiation therapy in treating children who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response to vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin (VID) with
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in children with newly diagnosed, inoperable
      or metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. II. Estimate the 2-year and
      event-free survival rates in children treated with VID plus radiotherapy and/or surgery.
      III. Establish a bank of frozen tumor and peripheral blood tissue for use in further
      molecular studies.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte
      Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 Mesna
      Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VID VCR/IFF/DOX Induction:
      3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID. Local Control: Surgery and/or Radiotherapy plus 3-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. Excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases; and/or
      irradiation of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases using x-rays or Co60 beam energies
      of at least 4 MV (electrons or iridium-192 implant allowed for boost); plus VID.
      Continuation: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be entered over 2.7 years if there are at
      least 7 responses in the first 20 patients.
